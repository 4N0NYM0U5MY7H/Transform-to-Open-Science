# Module 2: Open Tools & Resources

In this lesson,  learners will review the definition of open science and several other common terms including research products, data, software, and results. In addition, learners will review the Use, Make, Share framework, which is used as a tool to help you learn the processes and tasks associated with open science. The lesson wraps up with a discussion of the research lifecycle and management plan.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
* Define the foundational elements of open science including research products, the Use, Make, Share framework and why open science and data management plans are an important practice
* List and explain the purpose of resources used to discover and assess research products for reuse, including repositories, search portals, publications, documentation such as README files, metadata, and licensing
* Create a high-level strategy for making and sharing data that considers the FAIR principles, the use of a data management plan, the tracking of the data and authors with persistent identifiers and citations, and the selection of data formats and tools for making data and sharing associated results
* Describe the software lifecycle and create a high-level strategy for making and sharing software that considers the FAIR principles, the use of a software management plan, the tools needed for development including source code, kernels, programming languages, third-party software and version control, and lastly the tools and documentation used for publishing and curating open software
* List the considerations for determining whether a research product can or should be shared, and follow the steps in the Open Science Quick Start Guide for sharing data, software, papers, and other results
