# Module 1: The Ethos of Open Science

Welcome to this introductory module on open science. Open Science is a philosophy and practice of making science available for all, while accelerating and expanding scientific advancements. In this module, learners take a closer look at what open science is, the current landscape as well as the benefits and challenges. Learners then get a glimpse into the practice of open science including a case study. To start your journey with open science, learners are offered actions that one can take, including exploring communities that you can engage with now.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:

* Explain what open science is, why it's a good thing to do, and the mission of NASA TOPS
* List the benefits and challenges of open science adoption
* Describe the elements found in the practice of open science including considerations when writing the management plan and the tasks in the Use, Make, Share framework
* Explain some options when evaluating whether research products should or should not be open
* List ways to connect with others who are part of the open science community

**Lesson 1: What is Open Science?**  Defines open science, examples of open science in action, and why adopting Open Science is needed.

**Lesson 2: Why is Open Science important?** Explains benefits to you and society, and challenges and strategies for adopting open science.

**Lesson 3: How to do Open Science:** Describes open science and the scientific workflow, how open science impacts data and scientific research plans, introduction to the Use-Make-Share framework , and open science in action through a case study.

**Lesson 4: When not to be open:** Identifies conditions where research products should not be shared, practical examples of when research should not be shared, and pre-publication distribution considerations.

**Lesson 5: Where to learn more:**  Review ways to start your journey with open science, and a list of resources that you can use now.
