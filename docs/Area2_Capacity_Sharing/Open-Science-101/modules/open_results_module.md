# Module 5: Open Results

Welcome to Open Results! This module focuses on giving learners the tools they need to kick-start a scientific collaboration by creating contributor guidelines that ensure ethical contributorship. It starts out with a use case of open science in action, then a review of how to discover and assess open results. Next, the focus is on how to publish results which includes a task checklist. The module wraps up with a discussion on what subtleties to consider when determining what journal to publish in and how to plan the release of your data and software in conjunction with your paper!

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
* Describe what constitutes an open result
* Explain what the reproducibility crisis is and how open science can help combat it
* Use a process to discover, assess and cite open results for reuse
* List the responsibilities of the following participants that are creating open results: open results user, project leader, collaborator, contributor and author
* List the tasks for creating reproducible results and the items to include in a manuscript to ensure reproducible results
* Define a strategy for sharing your results including selecting publishers, interpreting journal policies and licenses, and determining when to share your data or software with your manuscript

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Results:** Broadens perspectives regarding what shareable research outputs are produced throughout the research lifecycle.

**Lesson 2: Using Open Results:** Familiarizes participants with utilization resources, how and when to cite the sources, how to provide feedback, and how to determine when it is appropriate to invite authors to be formal collaborators.

**Lesson 3: Making Open Results:** Explains about how to make reproducible results.

**Lesson 4: Sharing Open Results:** Explains how to appropriately and effectively share the results.
