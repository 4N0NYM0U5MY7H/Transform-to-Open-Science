# Module 4: Open Software

This module focuses on the practice and application of open science for software. It provides a 'how to' process that follows the software development lifecycle and Use, Make, Share framework. Some of the key topics discussed include: benefits and limitations of open software, how to discover and assess software, considerations and methods for programming following open principles, and finally when and how to share your software.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, learners will be able to:
* Explain what open source software means, including the software development cycle, the benefits of open software, and some common limitations and how they are addressed
* Discover open source software and assess it for reuse by evaluating provided documentation, including README files and licensing details; cite the software when appropriate
* Create an open source software management plan that includes the strategy for selecting open software dependencies and open repositories such as GIT, and how open elements including metadata, README files and version control, will be included to make the software reusable and findable
* Evaluate whether your open source software can be shared and the best options for sharing to increase visibility
* List the responsibilities a software developer has once the open source software is shared including managing legal requirements and ensuring the software is maintained

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Software.** Objectives include identifying core principles of open software, as well as learning the benefits and limitations.

**Lesson 2: Using Open Software.** Objectives include describing the process of using open software, and listing some key elements of discovering, assessing, reusing, and acknowledging open software. Participants will also recognize some common open software licenses and describe where they sit on the spectrum of openness, and describe under what circumstances, how, and where one should acknowledge the use of open software.

**Lesson 3: Making Open Software.** Objectives include listing several considerations when planning a new open software project; explaining reasons for open software projects to use version control; listing steps of the basic git process; explaining some types of information typically included in a README file; and describing several programming best practices that are essential for open software.

**Lesson 4: Sharing Open Software.** Objectives include understanding security concerns when publishing open software; recognizing the legal responsibilities of software developers; identifying ways to share your software and ways to expand its visibility; and describing the software developer's responsibilities for maintaining software.

**Lesson 5: Community Stories, Resources and Policy.** Objectives include reciting a few open software success stories and identifying where to find more; defining communities of practice and list at least one example for open source software; and listing some benefits of engaging with open source software communities when using open software and building a community when making and sharing open software.
