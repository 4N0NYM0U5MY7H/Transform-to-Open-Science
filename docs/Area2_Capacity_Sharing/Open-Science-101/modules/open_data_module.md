In this module, learners will explore the application of FAIR and CARE and best practices for using, making or sharing open data. The discussions are organized in the form of process steps that learners can take depending on their data. In addition, there is a discussion on what is usually expected in a data management plan, the process for assessing data for reuse, open formats and documentation, as well as considerations for sharing data and making your data citable.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, learners should be able to:
* Explain the benefits and challenges with practicing open science for data
* List the key tasks in finding, assessing, accessing and using existing data
* List the key requirements for making data open including how to make it interoperable, assessable, usable, findable and accessible
* Explain how considerations such as export controls and intellectual property limit the ability to make selected data open
* List the key requirements for successfully sharing open data
* Describe the data management plan including the common elements it should include

**Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Data:** What is open data and its benefits, and how can the FAIR and CARE principles be used to guide open data practices?  How can the use, make, share framework be used to modify a scientific plan for open data?

**Lesson 2: Using Open Data:** How to discover open data, how to assess if a dataset is open by evaluating the documentation, file format, metadata, and license details, and how to cite open data.

**Lesson 3: Making Open Data:** Data management plans, open data formats and tools for interoperability, how to include metadata and version control, and how to make data accessible and findable.

**Lesson 4: Sharing Open Data:** Process and considerations for sharing data, selecting, and working with a repository, maintaining and archiving data, and applying the appropriate data license.

**Lesson 5: Community Stories, Resources and Policy:** How to become involved in open data communities, and additional resources for open data.
