# Workshop Listing Requirements

TOPS offers the option to take Open Science 101 modules at workshops in both virtual and in-person formats.  This allows participants the benefit of getting trained through an instructor while taking availability into account. To facilitate signups, we have built a system through which instructors can list workshop and training dates on our website. Likewise, we encourage all instructors to request that their workshop details be listed [on this page](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/).

## General Requirements

These requirements apply to both in person and virtual instructor-led workshops that wish to be listed on the TOPS website.

* Your workshop must be free of charge.
* If you have not been provided with a registration page or registration information page, you are expected to create your own.
* You must clear your submission with TOPS by emailing [hq-openscience@nasa.gov](mailto:hq-openscience@nasa.gov) even if you would prefer to list your workshop through the steps outlined in our [website documentation](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/website#os101-workshops).

## In-Person Workshop Requirements

Below are the details that TOPS will ask for when you request your in-person workshop(s) be listed on our website.

* Date(s) of the workshop.
* The time(s) that the workshop will take place.
* The type of workshop.
  * This should be a general description (a few words) that best describes the workshop, and other useful information such as your organization name or the name of the conference.  For example "TOPST Summer School - My Org Name" or "Conference Workshop - AAS" would be great event type examples.
* The location of the workshop.
  * This includes the city name and the venue name.  An example of this is "Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA".
* The topic(s) of the workshop.
  * This is usually an OS 101 module such as "OS101 Module 2".
* Whether your workshop is internal to NASA or JPL.
  * Only contractors and employees will be able to attend these types of workshops.

## Adding a Workshop to the TOPS Website Yourself

Once you have cleared your request to list your workshop(s) with TOPS, you can allow us to take care of adding it for you.  This will communicated to our GitHub Lead.  

If have experience with GitHub and creating Pull Requests, you can optionally choose to add the workshop(s) yourself, and the GitHub Lead will help you merge it in.  You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/website#os101-workshops).
