## Take Open Science 101!
Open Science 101 is designed as five-module curricula that mimics a scientific workflow. The modules are facilitated in-person during large society meetings or during science team meetings, completed individually online, or completed via group-organized online events. Participants may complete all five modules virtually, or through a mix of in-person, online, and virtual instructor led training sessions.

The goal of Open Science 101 is to provide researchers, students, and citizen scientists with access to training on open science, empowering them to enhance their research practices and increase their chances of securing NASA funding by learning how to create an open science plan.

Upon completion of all five modules, participants earn a NASA Open Science virtual badge through Credly that can be displayed on social media and portfolio pages, a frameable certificate of achievement from NASA and a gold NASA TOPS pin to wear. We'd love for you to share your achievement on social media using #TOPSCertified.
